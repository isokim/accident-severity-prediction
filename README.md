# Road Accidents - Severity Prediction Model

This project uses linear regression to predict road accident severity based on features like road type, weather, speed limit, and driver details.

## Features Used:
- Road Type
- Weather Conditions
- Light Conditions
- Speed Limit
- Vehicle Type
- Road Condition
- Driver Age
- Alcohol Involvement

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib (for saving model)

## How to Run
1. Train the model with `accidents.py`
2. Load `road_accident_severity_model.pkl`
3. Predict using new accident scenarios
